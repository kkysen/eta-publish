# Check a commit message against the attribution style `CLAUDE.md` asks for.
#
# `Co-Authored-By:` is the mistake that keeps happening:
# the wrong casing still reads as right at a glance,
# so the spelling is checked mechanically rather than left to review.
#
# Only the mechanical rules are checked.
# Semantic line breaks and backticking file names are judgement calls,
# and a hook would reject correct messages.
#
# A commit a human wrote alone needs no attribution at all,
# and there is no way to tell who wrote a message from the message.
# `CLAUDECODE` is the closest thing to a signal:
# `claude` sets it in the environment it runs commands in,
# so it is set for a commit `claude` makes and unset for one typed in a terminal.
# It only gates whether the trailer is required;
# a trailer that is there is checked either way.
