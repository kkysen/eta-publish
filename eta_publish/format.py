"""Lay out and check what a build wrote: the HTML, the CSS, the JavaScript.

The emitter's job is what the page says; this is where it sits on the line.
What is emitted is committed and read as a diff, and a paragraph on one line
reports a corrected word as a changed paragraph.

One entry point, `tree`, over the finished output directory.

`biome` rather than a formatter written here: whether a line break is safe
in HTML is a question about which elements are inline, and getting it wrong
welds two words together on the page. A stylesheet and a script embedded in
the page are formatted as a stylesheet and a script, which no HTML-only
formatter does.

    laying out all of the HTML here.
    It lays out the saved API responses too, which changes how
    they are punctuated and not what they say.

    Once, not until it settles. `biome` 2.3.14 is not idempotent on HTML: run
    over its own output it breaks a handful of `<a href="...">` tags it had
    just fitted onto one line, four places in these reports. That is a bug in
    the formatter, and chasing it costs a whole further invocation to find out
    nothing is left, on a build where a run of `biome` is mostly the fixed
    cost of starting one.

    Taking the first result is still reproducible, which is what matters here:
    every build formats freshly emitted output, and nothing ever formats what
    is already committed, so one pass over the same input writes the same
    bytes as it did last time.
