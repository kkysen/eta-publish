"""What a report's embedded videos and posts look like before anyone plays them.

A page shows a card for each: who posted it, what it says, and a thumbnail.
The platform's own player is loaded only when the reader asks for it,
so reading the report asks nothing of YouTube, X, or Bluesky.

The card is looked up once and recorded in `embeds.json`, which is committed:
an offline build writes the same card, and a post deleted since keeps the one
it had. The thumbnail and a Drive video are files, rebuilt like the images.
