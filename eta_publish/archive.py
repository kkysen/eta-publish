"""The record of where each source the report cites has been archived.

A link is a claim about a page that is not ours and that nobody promised to
keep. The report outlives the page: `nypost.com` reorganizes, an agency retires
a PDF, a press release moves. So every source is captured once and the capture
is cited beside the original, and the record of which capture belongs to which
source is committed, because a report published in 2026 has to keep saying the
same thing in 2036.

Keyed by the original URL, never by the snapshot. A document that already cites
a `web.archive.org` URL has its link unwrapped at parse time and seeds the
record with the capture it named, so a source archived by hand and a source
archived here are the same source.

Like `images.py`, this is the side that touches the network and the filesystem;
the emitters read the result off the document and stay pure.

    page is a different question and only the index can answer it.
