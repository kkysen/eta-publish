"""Typst source, compiled to the report PDF.

Typst rather than HTML-to-PDF because footnotes belong at the bottom of the page.
HTML can only place them at the end of the document,
and with 21 of them carrying real argument,
that is the difference between a report and a printout of a web page.

A footnote's body is inlined at the reference site, which is how Typst wants it:
`#footnote[...]` marks the spot and carries the text,
and Typst does the numbering and the placement.
Nothing here keeps a separate list in sync,
which is the failure the HTML output has to guard against explicitly.

The emitted file is a document body that imports `template.typ`,
which carries the house style.
