"""Markdown for the committed, diffable archive.

Pandoc-flavored, because CommonMark has no footnotes and these reports run on them.
Where Pandoc and GitHub disagree, GitHub wins:
this file is read in the repository,
and GitHub supports the footnotes that made Pandoc necessary in the first place.

This is not what gets published.
It exists so that every regeneration lands in git as a readable diff:
what changed between draft 6 and draft 7, what the August 21 addendum added.
That is why the output breaks lines at sentences (see `sentences.py`).

The same report as the page and the PDF, not a different view of it:
the same headline, standfirst, date, and hero, in the same order,
and the same contributors at the end.
The header block is not here.
It is production scaffolding, `Draft Due Date:` and a discussion channel,
and `doc.json` beside this file keeps every field verbatim.
