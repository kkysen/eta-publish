"""What the log looks like, on a terminal and off one.

Two audiences and two answers.
On a terminal a build is being watched by somebody who is going to go and fix
what it names, and the layout is for reading.
Off one it is a file about to be searched, and the layout is one warning per
line with nothing in it that is not a word.
