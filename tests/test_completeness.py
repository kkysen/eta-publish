"""Nothing may vanish between the Google Doc and an output.

This is the failure the whole tool exists to prevent, and the one it has actually hit:
an early front-matter bug dropped the hero image and its caption with nothing reported.
Structure tests did not catch it,
because the structure that remained was perfectly well-formed.

There are two separate halves to check, and only together do they cover it:

- **source to tree**, that the parser keeps everything the document holds.
  This is the half that catches a bug like the front-matter overrun.
- **tree to output**, that no emitter loses what the parser produced.

The second cannot substitute for the first.
If the parser drops something,
it is absent from both sides of a tree-to-output comparison,
and that check passes while the content is gone.
