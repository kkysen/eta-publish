"""Snapshot of the real SAS West report, end to end.

`site/` is literally a publish of the real report,
at the top level because it is the site this project publishes
rather than a test fixture:

    uv run eta-publish all

The report lands under the path its own front matter names,
`reports/digging-out-deep-hole-sas-west/`, next to the index listing it.
That directory holds `doc.json`, the four outputs, `images/`, and `report.pdf`,
and this test asserts the committed outputs
still match what the code produces from the committed response.

`tests/fixture/` is the same directory in miniature,
built from a document nobody fetched, and the two differ by that and nothing else.
Either rebuilds from its own `doc.json` by passing the report directory back.
This is the only test running against a document nobody wrote to make a point,
and every bug that mattered so far
came from this document's shape rather than from a hand-built fixture.

Only the text is committed.
The images are 18 MB and the PDF 19 MB,
and a re-fetch rewrites every image, adding another copy to history permanently.
They are ignored, so the command above is safe to rerun.

`images.json` is the one derived thing kept:
a Docs `inlineObject` carries a `contentUri` with no extension and no mime type,
so the only way to learn an image is a JPEG is to fetch it,
and this test does not use the network.
It records the filename written for each image,
refreshed from `images/` whenever that directory is present.

When a snapshot changes, read the diff:
it is exactly what the change does to a real published report.
Accept it with `pytest --regenerate-snapshots`.

Kinds rather than the warnings themselves, and a subset rather than an equality:
what varies here is the document, and fixing the document is the point of a
warning. Asserted as a list, this test failed twice in one afternoon for reasons
that were not about the code: once when a new check started firing, and once
when the tag it complained about was taken off the doc, which is the warning
having worked.

What is still worth catching is a kind nobody has seen, because that is either
a check that started firing on this report or one that changed its wording.
The exact text of every warning the report publishes is pinned byte for byte
anyway, in the committed `report.md` and `index.html`: they are published on the
page, so the output snapshot is already the assertion that they have not moved.

Counts, image names and lengths are left loose on purpose. A seventeenth image
gaining a `Source:` line is not a thing this test should have an opinion about.
The phrase each one carries is enough to tell it from the others, so these are
substrings rather than patterns: there is nothing here to match loosely, and a
pattern over `\d+` and `(?:is|are)` would only be a way to get the plural wrong.
